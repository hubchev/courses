\subsection{The problem of value: The Water-Diamond Paradox}

\zitat{``Water is clearly important. We literally can't live without it. Yet you can get water in your apartment in New York without paying for it. On modern Roman streets you can wash your hands or bathe your dog at any old fire hydrant. In the office and in the dorm you can drink water from the fountain down the hall.
	
	Diamonds are different. You can live without diamonds. Yet they are very expensive, valued extremely highly per ounce in the marketplace.
	
	Notice how strange this is - how a good such as a diamond, which is beautiful but inessential, could be so much more expensive per ounce than an essential and not necessarily beautiful good, such as water. The case is called `the water/diamond paradox.' It is the first and the deepest question of value. What, after all, determines the value of things?'' --- \href{http://www.theeconomicconversation.com/book/ch5.1.php}{http://www.theeconomicconversation.com}}

\subsection{Elements of a market}
\itex{
	\item A market is any arrangement that brings buyers and sellers together.
	\item A \textbf{market} might be a physical place or a group of buyers and sellers spread around the world who never meet.
	\item In this chapter, we study a \textbf{competitive market} that has so many buyers and so many sellers that no individual buyer or seller can influence the price.
	\item \textbf{Quantity demanded} is the amount of a good, service, or resource that people are willing and able to buy during a specified period at a specified price.
	The quantity demanded is an amount per unit of time. For example, the amount per day or per month.
	\item \textbf{Supply and demand} are the forces that make market economies work because they determine prices in a market economy. 
	\item \textbf{Prices}, in turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources. 
	\item The model of the market based on supply and demand, like any other model, is based on a series of assumptions.}

\pbn
\boxx{
	\subsubsection*{Assumptions of the classical model}
	The classical model of supply and demand in free markets is basically based on the following assumptions (also see: exercise \ref{sol:Magic of the price system}):
	
	\itex{
		\item  Many buyers and sellers
		\item  Homogeneous products
		\item  Perfect information
		\item  Free entry and exit
		\item  Perfect mobility of factors of production 
		\item  Profit maximization
		\item  No externalities

\section{Demand}

\subsection{The law of demand}
Other things remaining the same,
\itex{\item 	If the price of the good rises, the quantity demanded of that good decreases.
	\item	If the price of the good falls, the quantity demanded of that good increases.

\subsection{Demand schedule and demand curve}
Demand is the relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of a good when all other influences on buying plans remain the same. 
Demand is illustrated by a demand schedule and a demand curve.
The demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded

\itex{\item Movements along the demand curve are caused by a change in the price of the product.

	\item  		A shift in the demand curve is caused by a factor affecting demand other than a change in price. }

\pbn
\exex{Sources of demand}{
	\itex{\item Can you think of factors that change demand for a given price? Do the prices of other goods play a role?
		\item A \textbf{substitute} is a good that can be consumed in place of another good.
		For example, apples and oranges are substitutes.
		\item A \textbf{complement} is a good that goes well with another good. For example, sausages and mustard or fish and chips.
		\item Fill in the blanks:\\
		The demand for a good \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases) if the price of one of its substitutes rises.\\
		The demand for a good \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases)  if the price of one of its substitutes falls.\\
		The demand for a good \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases)  if the price of one of its complement rises.\\
		The demand for a good \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases)  if the price of one of its complement falls.\\
		A rise in the expected future price of a good  \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases) the current demand for that good.\\
		A fall in the expected future price of a good  \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases) current demand for that good.\\
		\item A \textbf{normal good} is a good for which the demand increases if income increases and demand decreases if income decreases.
		\item An \textbf{inferior good} is a good for which the demand decreases if income increases and demand increases if income decreases.
		\item Can you give examples for normal and inferior goods.
		\item Fill in the blanks:\\
		When income is expected to increase in the future, or when credit is easy to get and the cost of borrowing is low, the demand for some goods  \rule{4em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases).\\
		When income is expected to decrease in the future, or when credit is hard to get and the cost of borrowing is high, the demand for some goods  \rule{5em}{0.15mm} (increases/decreases).\\
		\item Is the following statement true or false:\\
		Changes in expected future income and the availability and cost of credit has the greatest effect on the demand for big ticket items such as homes and cars.

\subsubsection{Movements along the demand curve}
Suppose the price of milk falls.
\itex{\item More milk will be demanded because of income and substitution effects.
	\item	\textbf{The income effect.} Assume that incomes remain constant. Then a fall in the price of milk means that consumers can now afford to buy more with their income. 
	\item \textbf{The substitution effect.} Milk is lower in price compared to other similar products so some consumers will choose to substitute the more expensive drinks with the now cheaper milk.
}

\pbn
\subsubsection{Shifts in the demand curve}
A shift in the demand curve---to the left or right---is caused by any change that alters the quantity demanded at every given price.

\paragraph{Shifting factors:}
\itex{\item Price of related goods: substitutes and complements
	\item Income: A lower income means consumer can spend less in total, so they spend less on some --and probably most-- normal goods but more on inferior goods.
	\item preferences
	\item number of buyers (population)
	\item advertising
	\item expectation of consumers if demand is influenced by expectations of future income and future prices

	\itex{\item	The price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded.

	\itex{\item	The quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price. 
		\item	Graphically, this is the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect.  	}}

\paragraph{What is an equilibrium}
In economics, economic equilibrium is a situation in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the (equilibrium) values of economic variables will not change.

\textbf{When we look on supply and demand:} Price adjustments lead to an alignment of the
quantities of goods supplied and demanded.

	Determine the equilibrium market price and quantity both graphically and algebraically.
}
\pbn


\solx{Demand and Supply}{
	To find the equilibrium, a.k.a. the intersection of the two functions, you need to solve the system of equations by solving both both equations fo either $x$ or $p$ and set both equal. To substitute for $x$ you should calculate
	\begin{align*}
		-\frac{3}{4}p + 300&=\frac{5}{4}p -100\\
		p^*&=200\\
		\textnormal{and } x^*&=150
	\end{align*}
	To substitute for $p$ you need to solve both equations for $p$:
	$$x = x(p) = -\frac{3}{4}  + 300 \Leftrightarrow p(x) = -\frac{4}{3}x +400$$
	$$x_S(p) = \frac{5}{4}p -100 \Leftrightarrow p_S(x) = \frac{4}{5} x +80$$
	and calculate
	\begin{align*}
		-\frac{4}{3}x +400&=\frac{4}{5} x +80\\
		x^*&=150\\
		\textnormal{and } p^*&=200
	\end{align*}
	The equilibrium market price and quantity is in $x=150$ and $p=200$.

\subsubsection{Supply < Demand (Shortage)}
\itex{\item	If price < equilibrium price, the quantity demanded > the quantity supplied.

\paragraph{Prices as signals}
\textbf{Law of supply and demand}
\itex{\item The price of any good adjusts in order to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded for that good into balance.
	\item The main function of a price in a free market is to act as a signal to both buyers and sellers. 
	\item Buyers check whether they are willing to pay the price of an item, i.e., if the benefits (\textit{utility}) exceeds the costs. 
	\item Sellers examine whether the price of a good exceeds the costs of production.
}

\paragraph{Three steps to analyzing changes in equilibrium}
\enux{\item Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or both).
	\item Decide whether the curve(s) shift(s) to the left or to the right.
