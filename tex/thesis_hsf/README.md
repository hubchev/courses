# thesis-hsf

Download all three files, open the hsf_template.tex with a LaTeX Editor of your choice, change it, compile it, and you have a pdf that looks like a thesis.

I recommend to use overleaf.com. It is a cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing and editing scientific documents. Just open a new project there, upload the three files and you are ready to go.
