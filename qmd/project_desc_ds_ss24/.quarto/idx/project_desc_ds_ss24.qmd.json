Recognizing the constraints of time, fully reproducing every statistic, table, and graph from the paper might not be feasible, and that's perfectly acceptable.\n\nTo ensure a focused and achievable project scope, please talk with me at least once during your study to align on what aspects are essential to replicate or investigate further. This consultation will help us stay in sync and clarify the priorities for your work.\n\nI encourage you to reach out to me proactively instead of waiting for me to initiate contact to ensure that we are fully aligned and understand each other's expectations and progress.\n\n## Give a presentation and publish it on GitHub Pages\n\nCreate a presentation using (R) Markdown and **Quarto**, and subsequently **publish it as a website through GitHub**. How to use Markdown and Quarto as well as how to publish a website on GitHub is explained [here](https://hubchev.github.io/dsbl/) [see @Huber2024Data]. \n\nThe presentation takes place on 20.12.2024 in 4e OG3. \n\nGiven the limited presentation time, prioritize key points to ensure you stay within the given timeframe without overly promoting yourself. Briefly describe and present the research paper, focusing more extensively on the dataset utilized in your study. The presentation should serve as a progress report, highlighting ongoing work rather than concluded results.\n\nIf you encounter weaknesses or challenges in conducting your reproduction study, the presentation is an appropriate platform to share these. The presentation is not the occasion for showcasing success stories. Similar to an internal business meeting, the interest lies in understanding the hurdles you face, as this opens the door for constructive feedback and suggestions that could help overcome these challenges.\n\n## Write the report\n\nThe report\n\n-   must be written with Quarto,\n-   should contain 4000-5000 words, or approximately 15 double-spaced pages, and\n-   should be published in\n    -   html standalone format and\n    -   PDF format.\n\nPlease note that this report is different from an academic paper in that it should focus solely on documenting, discussing, and presenting your project. Its purpose is to introduce your work to me in a way that is similar to reports written in business settings, where you focus on explaining what you did. Additionally, you should\n\n-   motivate your work and your procedure,\n-   mention briefly obstacles you overcame,\n-   discuss what challenges, problems and weaknesses remain, and\n-   suggest a strategy proceeding with your work if you would have had more time and resources.\n\nPlease refrain from trying to impress me with a fancy layout or any extraneous details. Your primary focus should be on effectively communicating your current state of work to the reader. Feel free to include anything that can help achieve this goal.\n\nPlease put some emphasize on guiding and motivating the reader. For example, the introduction is a good place to introduce the scope and content of the report. To ensure conciseness and clarity, please eliminate all unnecessary repetition. Take the time to read each sentence multiple times and ask yourself if it is concise, clear, and coherent with what was said before and after.\n\nI recommend writing the report as a Quarto book. @Telford2023Markdown is a good tutorial on how to write with Markdown and Quarto. Additionally, I recommend reading @Huber2024Data. For guidance on creating a standalone HTML file, refer to [this resource](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.html#standalone-html).\n\nIncorporate all R code relevant to reproducing the empirical findings directly into your Quarto file using code chunks. Your QMD file(s) must document the complete workflow, encompassing data import, cleaning, and analysis. While all code  should be included, it's not necessary to display every message and output generated by the code in the PDF document.\n\nThe outline of the paper must contain at least the following building blocks:\n\n-   Title and all common personal details (name, email, ...).\n-   Abstract of the paper (which highlights the content of the document).\n-   All the R code that is necessary to replicate your results.\n-   A section where you explain briefly how you published your presentation on GitHub, see @sec-gitgithub.\n-   A section where you explain briefly, how you made the pull request, see @sec-gitgithub.\n-   The Affidavit, see @sec-affidavit.\n\n## Make a pull request with Git and GitHub {#sec-gitgithub}\n\nAs mentioned above, you should publish your presentation using GitHub pages. Furthermore, you are required to make a pull request to my Github repository: [make_a_pull_request](https://github.com/hubchev/make_a_pull_request). What you should do here in detail is explained in the README of the repo and in @Huber2024Data. Remember to reference this pull request in your report.\n\n## Add this affidavit to your report {#sec-affidavit}\n\n*Your report should contain the following **Affidavit**.
