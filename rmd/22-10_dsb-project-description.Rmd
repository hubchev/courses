# Abstract {-}
In the following I describe the project that needs to be submitted in the course _Data Science for Business_. I give some hints for your efficient progress and success, I introduce the elements and files to be submitted, and I describe how I evaluate the submissions. 

# Main goal

__Course description__
*''Students complete this module with a project work. The project work includes a project report (15-20 pages) and a project presentation (20-30 minutes).''*

__Project work__

- Find an interesting dataset, 
- find a question that you aim to answer with data at hand, 
- try to answer the question using R and appropiate empirical methods, 
- write a report of the project, and 
- present your current status of the project in class. 

# Details

## Dataset 

- You can search for any kind of data. From my side there are no quantitative or qualitative specifications. 
- If you think you have found a data set, please contact me so we can discuss whether your data is appropriate. 


## Question

- When you think about a question to the data, try to come up with something that you are interested in. 
- Rest assured that this does not have to be a scientific question that can be answered accurately with the data at hand. An exploratory question is perfectly fine. I will give some examples in class and in some exercises.
- Again, I highly recommend to talk with me about your question and your goals. 


## The report

- The report should be about 5000-6000 words (which is about 15 double-spaced pages). 
- Unlike an _academic paper_, this is a report in which you should *just* document, discuss, and present your project. The report should introduce your work to me. It's similar to reports that you'll have to write in business, where your boss wants to know
  - What you did, 
  - why you did it the way you did, 
  - what obstacles you overcame, 
  - what challenges, problems and weaknesses remain, and 
  - how you would suggest proceeding with your work if you would have more time and ressources avalailable. 
- Please, don't try to impress me with a fancy layout or anything alike. Focus on the content and getting your knowledge across to the reader! Anything that helps with this is welcome.
- Guide and motivate the reader and outline the target audience of your work. Usually, the introduction is a good place to introduce the scope and content. In particular, make clear what is found in each section. 
- Be concise. Remove all unnecessary repetition. Read each sentence several times and ask yourself if it is concise and clear and if it fits with what was said before and after.
- The paper should be written with __R Markdown__. The .Rmd file with which this document is written, can be used as a template. This file is hosted at [my GitHub page:](https://github.com/hubchev/courses/tree/main/rmd) Information about writing and publishing with R Markdown can be found here:
  - [R Markdown from R Studio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  - [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) written by @Xie2018R.
  - [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) written by @Xie2020R.
  
- Insert R code in your R markdown file by typing the chunk delimiters (see the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl+Alt+I* for Windows and Linux based OS and *Cmd+Option+I* for Macintosh OS) or [this lesson](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)).
    
- The outline of the paper __must__ contain the following building blocks:
  - Title and all common personal details (name, email, ...).
  - Word count (see this rmd file on how to give a word count).
  - Abstract of the paper (which highlights the content of the document).
  - All the R code that is necessary to replicate your results.

## The presentation

- Write the presentation using R Markdown and publish it as .html and/or a .pdf file.
- Focus on the important things.
- Try to stay on time.
- Nobody is perfect and the project is done under time pressure. So don't try to sell yourself too hard. If you see weaknesses in your work, this is a good place to discuss them. 
- Describe and present your data set so that everyone has an idea of the structure and content of the data.
- Describe your question and if possible describe your plan to address the question with the data. Rest assured that you don't have to come up with a perfect strategy. It's okay if you don't know many empirical methods. 
- To facilitate the organization and scheduling of all presentations, please let me know the times you are available by __October 26__. A maximum of 3 presentations per meeting would be ideal. If you do not let me know your preferences, I will determine the time and date. Here is the link where you can give me your preferences and your availability:
[Doodle Poll: Data Science Presentation](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bD9mzKYd)
- We start with the presentations on October 10.

## rmd file

- The rmd file should contain the complete workflow including data import, data cleaning, and data analysis.
- Not all code or output of the code has to be shown in the pdf paper. See [Code Chunks and R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) how to set certain options to prevent code and results from appearing in the finished file.
  
# Submission
- Submission deadline for academic papers and written assessments: __13 February 2023__ _(please verify!)_
- Upload only __one .zip file__ containing the following:
  1. the paper as (a) .pdf and a (b) .html file. 
  2. the .Rmd file
  3. the data set (if not too large), 
  4. the presentation as (a) .Rmd and a (b) .html file,
  5. additional files, if needed, so that I can evaluate your work.
- Please also submit your work to my Github account at [https://github.com/hubchev/dsb-2023]()
  
# Evaluation 

- *65 % -- Quality and execution of the project*
    -- After your presentation, we will discuss your work in a personal meeting. The goal of this conversation will be that we agree on certain standards by which I will grade you. By this I mean that we define certain goals that you should achieve with your data set and your question. The goal is to create a transparent set of expectations on my part. So that you have an indication of what you need to accomplish at a minimum in order to pass the course.  

- *35 % -- Quality and execution of the presentation*

- I will try to evaluate your work as objectively as possible. In particular, I will 
	- check whether your submission is complete, or not,
  - check whether your empirical work can be reproduced,
  - check if all formal criteria are met, 
  - check for plagiarism,
  - read your work and evaluate your writing skills (clarity, coherence, grammar, etc.),
  - review and evaluate the novelty of your project,
  - evaluate the technical level of use of the programming language R for your empirical goals,
  - evaluate your argumentation,
  - assess whether your empirical reasoning makes sense and discuss your remaining weaknesses, 
  - acknowledge your learning process.

# Helpful stuff

*R Markdown*

To knit to all formats that are mentioned in the header, type that into the console (of course, don't forget to refer to your working directory using setwd()):

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("/home/sthu/Dropbox/hsf/github/courses/rmd/")
rmarkdown::render("22-10_dsb-project-description.Rmd", "all")
```

*Git and GitHub*

As you should submit your work to my Github account, you can learn how to do that by following the instructions of this repository: [https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
